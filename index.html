                    with a view to make Physical Fitness a way of life. FIT INDIA MOVEMENT aims at behavioural changes –
                    from sedentary lifestyle to physically active way of day-to-day living. Fit India would be a success
                    only when it becomes a people’s movement. We have to play the role of a catalyst.</p>

                    people to become part of FIT INDIA MOVEMENT by inculcating at least 45-60 minutes of physical
                    activities in their day to day lives, individuals and Youth Club can undertake various efforts for
                    their own health and well-being as well as for the health and well-being of fellow Indians. </p>

            <p class="text-big">It Can Make You Feel Happier. </p>
            <p class="text-small">Exercise has been shown to improve your mood and decrease feelings of depression,
                anxiety and stress (2Trusted Source).

                It produces changes in the parts of the brain that regulate stress and anxiety. It can also increase
                brain sensitivity for the hormones serotonin and norepinephrine, which relieve feelings of depression
                (1Trusted Source).

                Additionally, exercise can increase the production of endorphins, which are known to help produce
                positive feelings and reduce the perception of pain (1Trusted Source).

                Furthermore, exercise has been shown to reduce symptoms in people suffering from anxiety. It can also
                help them be more aware of their mental state and practice distraction from their fears (1Trusted
                Source).

                Interestingly, it doesn't matter how intense your workout is. It seems that your mood can benefit from
                exercise no matter the intensity of the physical activity.</p>

            <p class="text-big">It Can Help With Weight Loss </p>
            <p class="text-small">To understand the effect of exercise on weight reduction, it is important to
                understand the relationship between exercise and energy expenditure.

                Your body spends energy in three ways: digesting food, exercising and maintaining body functions like
                your heartbeat and breathing.

                While dieting, a reduced calorie intake will lower your metabolic rate, which will delay weight loss. On
                the contrary, regular exercise has been shown to increase your metabolic rate, which will burn more
                calories and help you lose weight (5Trusted Source, 6Trusted Source, 7Trusted Source, 8Trusted Source)..

            <p class="text-big">It Can Help With Relaxation and Sleep Quality </p>
            <p class="text-small">Regular exercise can help you relax and sleep better (37Trusted Source, 38Trusted
                Source).

                In regards to sleep quality, the energy depletion that occurs during exercise stimulates recuperative
                processes during sleep (38Trusted Source).

                Moreover, the increase in body temperature that occurs during exercise is thought to improve sleep
                quality by helping it drop during sleep (39Trusted Source).

                Many studies on the effects of exercise on sleep have reached similar conclusions.

                One study found that 150 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous activity per week can provide up to a 65%
                improvement in sleep quality (40).

                Another showed that 16 weeks of physical activity increased sleep quality and helped 17 people with
                insomnia sleep longer and more deeply than the control group. It also helped them feel more energized
                during the day (41Trusted Source).</p>
